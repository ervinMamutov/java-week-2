# 📚 Java Projects – Week 2

Welcome to **Week 2** of Java learning projects!  
This week we’ll go beyond the basics and start working with **methods**, **arrays**, **multidimensional arrays**,
and an introduction to **classes and objects**.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered
- Defining and invoking **methods**
- Method **parameters and return types**
- **Arrays** (1D) and **multidimensional arrays**
- Introduction to **Classes** and **Objects**

---

## 📝 Project Ideas

### 1. ➕ Advance Calculator
**Concepts used:** Methods, parameters, return types.
- Create separate methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division , and modulus.
- Make it works for integers and doubles.
- Ask the user for two numbers and an operation.
- Call the correct method and return the result.
- Example:
```java
public static int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
public static double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
````

### 2. 📊 Array Statistics

**Concepts used:** Arrays, loops, methods.

* Ask the user to enter `n` numbers and store them in an array.
* Write methods to calculate:

    * Maximum value
    * Minimum value
    * Average
    * Sum
* Print all results.

---

### 3. 🏀 2D Array Scoreboard

**Concepts used:** Multidimensional arrays, nested loops.

* Create a `2D array` representing scores of **3 players across 5 games**.
* Fill the array with random numbers (e.g., 0–100).
* Print the scores in a table format.
* Calculate and display the total score of each player.

---

### 4. 📖 Book Information (Intro to Classes)

**Concepts used:** Classes, objects, fields, methods, constructors.

* Create a `Book` class with fields: `title`, `author`, `year`.
* Add a constructor to initialize the book.
* Add a method `printDetails()` that prints all info.
* In `main`, create two `Book` objects and call `printDetails()` on each.

---

### 5. 🏫 Student Report (Arrays + Objects)

**Concepts used:** Arrays of objects, loops, classes.

* Create a `Student` class with fields: `name`, `age`, `marks`.
* Create an array of `Student` objects.
* Use a loop to display each student’s information.
* Add a method `isPassed()` that checks if marks ≥ 40.
* Print whether each student passed or failed.

---

### 6. 🎲 Dice Roller with Methods

**Concepts used:** Methods, random numbers, loops.

* Write a method `rollDice()` that returns a random number between 1–6.
* Ask the user how many times they want to roll the dice.
* Call `rollDice()` that many times and print the results.

## 🚀 Learning Goals

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

* Write and reuse your own **methods**.
* Handle **arrays** and **multidimensional arrays** effectively.
* Understand the basics of **classes and objects**.
* Combine arrays, loops, and objects in small projects.
